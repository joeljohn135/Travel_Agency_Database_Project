## REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION:
<br>
We have created a Database System for a Travel Agency called ‘Travel Agency’ located in the United Arab Emirates.

We require a Customer’s Personal Details as well as their Travel Details to be entered into our system. When a Customer decides on which Package they want to avail, a Booking is made for them.

Our Database provides Packages to a Customer based on the location they wish to travel to. 
Packages come with multiple hotels for a destination. We also provide an option of Activities that a Customer can choose ranging from sightseeing to entertainment! 

The Entity Sets we have started off with is 
Customer - contains personal and contact details of a customer
Customer Travel Details -  contains a customer’s passport details
Booking- contains booking id, start and end date of the booking and the price
Package- contains details of the hotel, transport and activities of a package
Airplane- contains information about flight details, such as FlightNo and departure time etc.
Hotel- contains information about the hotel where the customer will be staying
Activity- contains information about the activities provided in the package
